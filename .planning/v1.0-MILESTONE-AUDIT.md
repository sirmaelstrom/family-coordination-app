# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 - Family Coordination App MVP
**Audited:** 2026-01-25T04:30:00Z
**Status:** TECH_DEBT (no blockers, accumulated debt needs review)

## Executive Summary

All 34 v1 requirements satisfied. All 7 phases complete. All 5 E2E user flows functional.
3 minor integration gaps and documented tech debt items exist but none are blockers.

## Requirements Coverage

| Category | Requirements | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Authentication | AUTH-01 through AUTH-04 | 4/4 Complete |
| Data & Infrastructure | DATA-01 through DATA-04 | 4/4 Complete |
| Recipe Management | RECIPE-01 through RECIPE-06 | 6/6 Complete |
| Meal Planning | MEAL-01 through MEAL-06 | 6/6 Complete |
| Shopping Lists | SHOP-01 through SHOP-10 | 10/10 Complete |
| Collaboration | COLLAB-01 through COLLAB-04 | 4/4 Complete |
| Mobile & UX | MOBILE-01 through MOBILE-04 | 4/4 Complete |
| **Total** | **34 requirements** | **34/34 (100%)** |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Goal | Status | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| 1. Foundation | Database, auth, Docker | Complete | human_needed → approved |
| 2. Recipe Management | CRUD with ingredients | Complete | passed |
| 3. Meal Planning | Weekly calendar | Complete | human_needed → approved |
| 4. Shopping List Core | Generation, consolidation | Complete | passed |
| 5. Multi-User Collaboration | Polling sync, attribution | Complete | passed |
| 6. Recipe Import | URL scraping, JSON-LD | Complete | human verified (06-06-SUMMARY) |
| 7. Mobile & UX Polish | PWA, touch, responsive | Complete | human_needed → approved |

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Connected (15/18)

1. **Recipes → Meal Plan** — RecipePickerDialog uses RecipeService ✓
2. **Meal Plan → Shopping List** — ShoppingListGenerator fetches meal plan entries ✓
3. **Recipe Import → Recipe Management** — Imported recipes appear in list ✓
4. **Polling → Recipes page** — DataNotifier triggers reload ✓
5. **Polling → Shopping List page** — DataNotifier triggers reload ✓
6. **User → Attribution (partial)** — CreatedBy/AddedBy tracked on most entities ✓
7. **Auth → All pages** — WhitelistedEmailRequirement enforced ✓
8. **Setup → First-run wizard** — Middleware redirects correctly ✓
9-15. **Navigation** — All routes properly linked ✓

### Gaps (3)

| From | To | Issue | Severity |
|------|-----|-------|----------|
| RecipeEdit | Recipe.UpdatedByUserId | Not set before UpdateRecipeAsync | Moderate |
| MealPlanService | UpdatedAt | Not set when updating entry | Moderate |
| MealPlan.razor | DataNotifier | No subscription for real-time updates | Minor |

**Impact:** Recipe edit attribution incomplete. Meal plan changes won't trigger polling for other users. Neither blocks core functionality.

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| New User (OAuth → Setup → Home) | ✓ Complete | All steps verified |
| Recipe Creation (Manual or Import) | ✓ Complete | Both paths work |
| Meal Planning (Select → Assign → View) | ✓ Complete | Calendar and list views |
| Shopping (Generate → Check → Sync) | ✓ Complete | Consolidation works |
| Collaboration (User A → User B) | ✓ Complete | Polling sync functional |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 2: Recipe Management
- RecipeEdit.razor missing `UpdatedByUserId` assignment (attribution gap)

### Phase 3: Meal Planning
- MealPlanService.AddMealAsync missing UpdatedAt/UpdatedByUserId
- MealPlan.razor missing DataNotifier subscription (no real-time meal plan updates)

### Phase 4: Shopping List Core
- Drag-drop reordering deferred (Razor compiler conflict with Dropzone component)
- Simple ingredient normalization may miss semantic matches

### Phase 6: Recipe Import
- Food Network: 403 Forbidden (bot detection) - documented limitation
- Epicurious: Old URLs broken - documented limitation
- **Documented in UI:** Import dialog lists supported sites

### No Anti-Patterns Found
All phases passed anti-pattern scans. No TODO/FIXME comments, no stub implementations, no placeholder content in production code.

## Recommendation

**Proceed with milestone completion.**

All requirements satisfied. All flows functional. Tech debt items are:
- Non-blocking (app works correctly)
- Documented (known limitations)
- Deferrable (can address in v1.1 polish phase)

The 3 integration gaps affect attribution tracking and meal plan real-time sync. These are "nice-to-have" for a family app where users are typically in the same household and don't need granular change tracking.

## Actions

- [x] All phase VERIFICATION.md files read
- [x] Tech debt aggregated from all phases
- [x] Integration checker verified cross-phase wiring
- [x] E2E flows verified
- [ ] User decision: complete milestone or address tech debt first
