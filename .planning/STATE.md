## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Blazor Server over Blazor WASM (C# expertise, built-in SignalR, simpler deployment)
- PostgreSQL over SQL Server (Linux deployment, open source, Docker-friendly)
- Single-tenant MVP with HouseholdId for future multi-tenant expansion
- Google OAuth only (family uses Google, no password reset complexity)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: Ingredient consolidation requires NLP/semantic matching strategy (research flagged)
- Phase 5: Conflict resolution strategy for concurrent edits (research flagged)
- Phase 6: Anti-bot mitigation for recipe scraping (research flagged)
