  <what-built>Mobile & UX Polish: PWA support, touch optimization, responsive layouts, sync status indicator</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
## Setup

Deploy to Docker and access via HTTPS (PWA requires secure context):
```bash
cd /home/sirm/projects/github/family-coordination-app
./docker-build.sh && docker-compose up -d
```

Access at: https://family.example.com (or localhost if testing locally)

---

## PWA Installation (MOBILE-03)

**On iPhone:**
1. Open Safari → family.example.com
2. Tap Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
3. Name it and tap Add
4. Open from home screen
5. Expected: App opens fullscreen (no Safari UI)

**On Android:**
1. Open Chrome → family.example.com
2. Look for "Install" banner or tap ⋮ → "Install app"
3. Open from home screen
4. Expected: App opens standalone

**In Chrome DevTools:**
1. Application → Manifest → Check "Installable"
2. Application → Service Workers → Check "Activated"

---

## Touch Targets (MOBILE-02)

**Shopping List:**
1. Navigate to Shopping List
2. Try checking/unchecking items
3. Expected: Easy to tap with thumb, no mis-taps
4. Try tapping edit/delete buttons on items
5. Expected: Comfortable touch targets, no accidental triggers

**General:**
1. Navigate through all pages
2. Tap various buttons and interactive elements
3. Expected: Nothing feels too small or cramped

---

## Responsive Layout (MOBILE-01)

**On Phone (or DevTools mobile view):**
1. Shopping List: Items readable, no horizontal scroll
2. Meal Plan: Shows list view (not cramped calendar)
3. Recipes: Cards in single column, expandable
4. Recipe Edit: Form fields full-width, usable

**Check for issues:**
- Horizontal scrolling on any page = FAIL
- Text too small to read = FAIL
- Buttons cut off or overlapping = FAIL

---

## Sync Status (MOBILE-04)

**Normal operation:**
1. Use app normally
2. Expected: Green cloud/checkmark in header (subtle)

**Simulate offline:**
1. In Chrome DevTools → Network → Offline
2. Expected: Warning icon appears, offline banner shows
3. Try to make a change
4. Expected: Change appears locally (optimistic) with warning

**Recover:**
1. Uncheck "Offline" in DevTools
2. Expected: Status returns to synced, banner disappears

---

## Performance (Nice to have)

1. Open DevTools → Lighthouse → Run mobile audit
2. Check "Performance" score (target: 80+)
3. Check "PWA" badge (should be present)
